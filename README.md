# ElmerSalome
Plugin for SALOME platform to access Elmer functionality 

Installation:
  create a plugin directory in the root path of SALOME or somewhere convenient
  copy all .py-files into this directory
  register the directory via the SALOME_PLUGIN_PATH system variable
  
ToDo:
  check whether registration via system variables can be bypassed by using the env.bat batch file that starts SALOME
